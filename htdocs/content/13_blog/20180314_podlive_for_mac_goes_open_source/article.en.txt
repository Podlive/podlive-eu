Podlive for Mac has been available free of charge for some time from the (link: https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/podlive/id1210411572?mt=12 text: Mac App Store). Unfortunately, the development is always a bit behind the iOS version - lately more than at the beginning. This is simply due to the fact that I currently have really little time to devote to this project. That's a pity, but that's just the way it is...

To keep the project from getting dusty, we decided to release the macOS version as open source software.

**Any enthusiastic developer is welcome to participate in the further development of the project.** There are enough ideas and desires. If you are interested, simply contact us (email: mail@podlive.io text: by email) or ping us (link: https://twitter.com/PodliveApp text:on Twitter).

Happy coding! ðŸ›
